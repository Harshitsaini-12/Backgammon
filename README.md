- **Legal Moves Selection:** Lists all legal moves and allows players to select them.
- **Pip Command:** Reports pip count for both players.
- **Hint Command:** Lists all available commands.

- **Game Over Detection:** Identifies when a game ends and announces the winner.

### Sprint 3
- **Dice Command:** Allows setting custom dice rolls.
- **Test Command:** Executes commands from a file for testing purposes.
- **Match Setup:** Allows players to enter names and select match length at the start of a new match.
- **Display Match Score:** Shows match score and length on the board.
